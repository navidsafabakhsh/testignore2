Placeit's mockup templates and videos are here to help with that. Placeit's app and online marketing tools are created to help you promote your business. So how does it work? Well, first you need to pick a mockup template to use for your iOS app/ website. Like this scene, for example; it features an iPad Mini and the bottom part of a Dell Ultrabook's keyboard. They're both sitting on top of a beautiful wood floor. The simplicity of the background doesn't distract from the iPad Mini's screen, but it still somehow enhances the overall effect of the scene. The iPad Mini's screen is front and center and the eye is naturally drawn to it. Which makes it perfect to use as part of your online marketing strategy. Next, after you've chosen this scene, you'll take a screenshot from your iOS app or website and place it onto the iPad's screen. Finally, you'll download the mockup and then you're ready to share your brand new online marketing tool with the world. </image:caption><image:title>iPad Mini Next to Laptop Mockup Template Generator</image:title></image:image></url><url><loc>https://placeit.net/#!/stages/business-man-ipad-mockup</loc><lastmod>2015-04-06</lastmod><changefreq>weekly</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority><image:image><image:loc>https://placeit.net/uploads/stage/stage_image/1650/small_IMG_9088_standard_base.jpg</image:loc><image:caption>A business man, wearing a nice black suite and white shirt, holds an iPad in this iPad Mockup.

&lt;p&gt;If your app is targeted for a creative audience, you should definitely consider this &lt;strong&gt;mockup&lt;/strong&gt;. You can place your design into the screen and it will automatically be rendered with the appropriate reflections, glare and shadows to create a &lt;strong&gt;photorealistic mockup&lt;/strong&gt; to present your design. It is always useful, specially if you are developing an &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6&lt;/strong&gt; app, to show your design in context, allowing your users (or clients) to see themselves using your app. Remember you can also input a URL to show it on the device&amp;#8217;s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6 mockup&lt;/strong&gt; like this one is very versatile. The brown and green combination goes well with most designs you can imagine. However, if you are looking for different colors, backgrounds or environments, try one of our other &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 6 mockups&lt;/strong&gt; on the left.

Then consider partnering with Placeit with your online marketing strategy. How does it work? It's really easy; first you pick a mockup template with a scene that fits your needs and speaks to you, next you drag a screenshot from your website and drag it onto the screen or screens of the template, then you can download the template with your screenshot and you'll have created an amazing marketing tool for your use. Take this fun scene for example; it features a young woman, sitting on the floor, relaxing with her Asus laptop. The stunning wood floor she's sitting on, provides an elegant background for this scene. You can see the smile on the side of her face, as she gazes down at her Asus, you can feel how happy she is. But the real star of this scene, is that big beautiful screen that belongs to that Asus laptop mockup template. That screen is angled perfectly for your detailed screenshot. All you need to do is add it to this scene and suddenly it's your website that's making this young woman so happy!</image:caption><image:title>Mockup Generator of Young Woman Using PC Laptop on Wooden Floor</image:title></image:image></url><url><loc>https://placeit.net/#!/stages/iphone-5s-grey-portrait-on-crystal-surface</loc><lastmod>2014-07-10</lastmod><changefreq>weekly</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority><image:image><image:loc>https://placeit.net/uploads/stage/stage_image/849/small_IMG_6345-stage.jpg</image:loc><image:caption>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;This stage has a great simple design to show off your &lt;strong&gt;app mock up.&lt;/strong&gt; There is an &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 5s gray&lt;/strong&gt; on a blue table.

He chooses two of them and puts them on his coffee table. Then, before diving in, he takes out his iPhone 6 and checks out your app. On his screen, we can see your app's flow. Or maybe just your design? Or your website? You choose! Just record your screen to generate an impressive app demo video, with full gestures created from your mouse clicks and movements. This app demo video template is versatile, although it would probably fit better with apps for studying, book reviews, casual or maybe even productivity apps. Whichever you have, make sure to try this template out and download an HD app demo video today.</image:caption><image:title>App Demo Video of Young Man Using iPhone 6 and Doing Homework</image:title></image:image></url><url><loc>https://placeit.net/#!/stages/black-nexus-7-portrait--2</loc><lastmod>2014-02-19</lastmod><changefreq>weekly</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority><image:image><image:loc>https://placeit.net/uploads/stage/stage_image/472/small_nexus-7-base.png</image:loc><image:caption>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;Nexus 7 iPad mockup&lt;/strong&gt; puts you into a &lt;strong&gt;picnic&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;scenario&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;It is displaying your 800 x 1280 px &lt;strong&gt;portrait screenshot.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose from a large variety of &lt;b&gt;swappable backgrounds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This &lt;strong&gt;stage&lt;/strong&gt; would be good for a &lt;strong&gt;target audience&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;artists, photographers, galleries, frame shops, or museums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
